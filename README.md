_Sass, HTML, CSS, Frontend_

## üìî Description

The objective of this pill is to put the basic foundations of SASS into practice, by creating a tiny HTML website in which SASS styles are applied.

### üìÇ Content

This repository contains the files and folders detailed below:

- **_assets_**: folder used to store different elements needed during the realization of the project organized in sub-folders, including:

  - **_css_**: here it is stored the compiled version of the respective _.sass_ files.

  - **_img_**: images related with the design of both the login and the home views.

  - **_sass_**: stylesheets used during the completion of the exercise. After its compilation with the command _`sass --watch "origin .sass file":"destination .css file"`_, a usable version is created with the corresponding styles and the extension _.css_, which is renderable by the browser and referenced in the html files.

- **_home.html_**: home view of the webpage, consisting on a navigation bar and a main section where people's posts are displayed.

- **_login.html_**: login view of the webpage, consisting on some content arranged in two columns and a footer.

- **_README.md_**: this file.
